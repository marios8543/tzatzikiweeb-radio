# [tzatzikiweeb Radio](https://radio.tzatzikiweeb.moe)

tzatzikiweeb radio source code. Shares much of the code of the earlier [NetMusicPlay project](https://github.com/marios8543/NetMusicPlay).  
This uses jellyfin as the library manager and simply serves the relevant radio API.  
It does NOT serve audio files, those are fetched from external CDN.
